//// Basic note

/// How to create new cargo
// cargo new hello_cargo


/// Run your code cargo
// ./target/debug/hello_cargo


/// Cargo summary
// We can build a project using cargo build.
// We can build and run a project in one step using cargo run.
// We can build a project without producing a binary to check for errors using cargo check.
// Instead of saving the result of the build in the same directory as our code, Cargo stores it in the target/debug directory.


/// bringing library
use std::io;
// By default, Rust has a few items defined in the standard library 
// that it brings into the scope of every program. This set is called 
// the prelude, and you can see everything in it in the standard 
// library documentation. If a type you want to use isnâ€™t in the 
// prelude, you have to bring that type into scope explicitly with 
// a use statement. Using the std::io library provides you with a 
// number of useful features, including the ability to accept user 
// input.



/// mutable variabel
let mut guess = String::new(); 
/// this is mutable
let fruit = "Apple" 
/// this isn't mutable, like const on javascript


/// note about std::io::stdin
// If we hadnâ€™t imported the io library with use std::io
// at the beginning of the program, we could still use the
// function by writing this function call as std::io::stdin
// The stdin function returns an instance of std::io::Stdin,
// which is a type that represents a handle to the standard
// input for your terminal.


/// calling method
.method_name()


/// using rand cargo
use rand::Rng


/// code explenation
    io::stdin() 
    /// this is function to handle standar input for terminal
        .read_line(&mut guess) 
        /// this is method on the standard input handle to get input from the user
        .expect("Failed to read line"); // method to display this massage if code crash


        /// code explenation
let secret_number = rand::thread_rng().gen_range(1..101);
rand::thread_rng // This is function to gives us the particular random number generator
gen_range(1..101) // This is method takes a range expression as an arguments gen_range(start..end)
// 1..101 is equivalent with 1..=100


/// cmp method
use std::cmp::Ordering;
// cmp is method to compare 2 value\
// Ordering is enum that have 3 variant (Less, Greater, and Equal)


/// Using method to value
match guess.cmp(&secret_number) { //this code is comparing guess with secret_number
    Ordering::Less => println!("Too small!"),
    Ordering::Greater => println!("Too big!"),
    Ordering::Equal => println!("You win!"),
} // match expression i use to decide wha to do next vased on which variant of
// ordering was returned with values in guess, this match is like alternative if else


///code analysis
let guess: u32 = guess.trim().parse().expect("Please type a number!");
// rust allows us to shadow the previous value of guess with new one
// Shadowing lets us reuse the guess variable name rather than forcing
// us to create two unique variables. code aboove bind variable to expression//
guess.trim().parse()
// guess in expression refers to the original guess variable that contain sring input
// trim method in string will eliminate any whitespace \n(newline) or \r\n
// then parse method is convert the string to some type of number
// it's only works to string that can logically turn into number, and it so easily result error
let guess: u32
// : after guess tells Rust we'll annotate the variable's tyoe
// u32 is unsigned 32=bit integer


/// Handling invalid input
//From 
let guess: u32 = guess.trim().parse().expect("Please type a number");
//To
let guess: u32 = match guess.trim().parse() {
    Ok(num) => num,
    Err(num) => continue,
}; // swithc from expect call to match expression like cmp method


//// Chapter 3 (Commong Programming Concept)
/// Set of word that cannot use in rust
// https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/appendix-01-keywords.html

/// Variables and Mutability
// by default variables are immutable
let mut x = 5; // use mut to make variable mutable
println!("The value of x is: {}", x);
x = 6; // change variable value
println!("Then value of x change to: {}", x);

/// constants
const SECOND_IN_A_DAY: u32 = 60 * 60 * 24;
// you not allowed to use mut in constants
// Constants arenâ€™t just immutable by defaultâ€”theyâ€™re always immutable
// Constants can be declared in any scope, including the global scope, 
// which makes them useful for values that many parts of code need to know about.

/// shadowing
// shadowing is redeclare variable with let
// let keyword allow us to perform fer transformations on a value
// it's different with mut. without mut we can't redeclare variable like this
let x = 5;
x = x + 1;

// but this allowed
let x = 5;
let x = x + 1;


/// Data types
// rust is a statically syped language

//*Scalar Type

//**Integer Type (sined integer types start with i instead of u) */
// Length  Signed   Unsigned
// 8-bit   i8       u8
// 16-bit  i16      u16
// 32-bit  i32      u32
// 64-bit  i64      u64
// 128-bit i128     u128
// arch    isize    usize
// Signed number just can be just negative or positive, and unsigned can be positive
// Each signed variant can store numbers from -(2^n - 1) to 2^n - 1
// we can write integer literals in any of forms below

// Number literals  Example
// Decimal          98_222
// Hex              0xff
// Octal            0o77
// Binary           0b1111_0000
// Byte (u8 only)   b'A'
// Defaul rust integer type is i32

//** FLoating-point Types */
// Rust also have floating-point numbers, which are numbers with decimal
// it's f32 and f64

// Tuples have a fixed length: once declared, they cannot
// grow or shrink in size.
