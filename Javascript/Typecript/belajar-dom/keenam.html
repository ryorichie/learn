<!-- Event bubbling and event capturing are two models of event propagation in HTML DOM. 

Event Capturing: 
In this model, an event is first captured by the outermost element and then propagated to the innermost element. 

Event Bubbling: 
In this model, an event is first captured by the innermost element and then propagated to the outermost element. 

Now, if we attach an event handler to both the parent and child div for the same event (let's say, a click event), and then trigger that event on the child div, the order of event propagation will be different for event bubbling and event capturing. 

For event bubbling, the event will first be captured by the child div and then propagated to the parent div. 

For event capturing, the event will first be captured by the parent div and then propagated to the child div. -->
